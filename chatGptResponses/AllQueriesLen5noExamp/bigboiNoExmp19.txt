Here are the SQLite code snippets for the given questions:

1. Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower?
```
SELECT model
FROM cars_data
JOIN car_names ON cars_data.id = car_names.makeid
JOIN model_list ON car_names.modelid = model_list.modelid
ORDER BY horsepower ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

2. What is the model of the car with the smallest amount of horsepower?
```
SELECT model
FROM cars_data
JOIN car_names ON cars_data.id = car_names.makeid
JOIN model_list ON car_names.modelid = model_list.modelid
ORDER BY horsepower ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

3. Find the model of the car whose weight is below the average weight.
```
SELECT model
FROM cars_data
JOIN car_names ON cars_data.id = car_names.makeid
JOIN model_list ON car_names.modelid = model_list.modelid
WHERE weight < (
    SELECT AVG(weight)
    FROM cars_data
);
```

4. What is the model for the car with a weight smaller than the average?
```
SELECT model
FROM cars_data
JOIN car_names ON cars_data.id = car_names.makeid
JOIN model_list ON car_names.modelid = model_list.modelid
WHERE weight < (
    SELECT AVG(weight)
    FROM cars_data
);
```

5. Find the name of the makers that produced some cars in the year of 1970?
```
SELECT DISTINCT maker
FROM car_makers
JOIN model_list ON car_makers.id = model_list.maker
JOIN car_names ON model_list.modelid = car_names.modelid
JOIN cars_data ON car_names.makeid = cars_data.id
WHERE year = 1970;
```
